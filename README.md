TouchOSC-Mouse
==============

Control your mouse with your iPhone or Android via TouchOSC

## Installation

This is a work in progress. Currently just use Eclipse to open the project and run in through there.

## Usage

Your phone and computer have to be on the same wifi network. [or else you have to be able to connect with osc via a publicly accessible port, that is up to you].

* Run the program in Eclipse.
* Find your computer's ip address.
* Launch TouchOSC on port 44100, using the ip address you just found.
* Turn on Accelerometer
* Use `Beatmachine` layout
